        "###1.**What is a RESTful API4**?\n",
        ">A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service that follows REST (a set of architectural principles for building networked applications). RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.**Explain the concept of API specification**?\n",
        " >An API specification is a detailed document or standard that defines how an Application Programming Interface (API) should function. It outlines the rules, endpoints, data formats, authentication methods, and other important aspects needed for developers to interact with the API correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3.**What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs**?\n",
        " >Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, commonly used to build web applications and APIs. It is based on Werkzeug (for handling requests and responses) and Jinja2 (a template engine).\n",
        " >Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it has no built-in ORM, authentication, or other heavy features. Developers can add only the libraries they need.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4.**What is routing in Flask**?\n",
        ">Routing in Flask is the process of defining URLs (routes) that are associated with specific functions, allowing users to navigate a web application. When a user accesses a particular URL, Flask executes the corresponding function and returns the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "###5.**How do you create a simple Flask application**?\n",
        ">Install Flask → pip install flask\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Create app.py → Initialize Flask app\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Define Routes → Use @app.route()\n",
        "\n",
        "->Run the App → python app.py\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Access in Browser → http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###6.**What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs**?\n",
        ">RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET - Retrieves data from a server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: GET /users (fetches a list of users)\n",
        "\n",
        "POST – Creates a new resource on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: POST /users (creates a new user)\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT – Updates an existing resource or creates it if it does not exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: PUT /users/123 (updates user with ID 123)\n",
        "\n",
        "PATCH – Partially updates an existing resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: PATCH /users/123 (updates some fields of user 123)\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE – Removes a resource from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: DELETE /users/123 (deletes user 123)\n",
        "\n",
        "HEAD – Similar to GET but only retrieves headers, not the body.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: HEAD /users (fetches metadata about users)\n",
        "\n",
        "OPTIONS – Returns the allowed HTTP methods for a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: OPTIONS /users (lists allowed methods: GET, POST, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "TRACE – Echoes the received request, used for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: TRACE /users (returns what the server receives)\n",
        "\n",
        "CONNECT – Establishes a tunnel to a server, often used with proxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: CONNECT example.com:443 (creates a secure tunnel)\n",
        "\n",
        "The main methods used in RESTful APIs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, as they align with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "###7.**What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask**?\n",
        ">n Flask, the @app.route() decorator is used to define a URL route that maps to a specific function. This means that when a user visits a particular URL in the web application, Flask will execute the associated function and return the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of @app.route()\n",
        "Defines Routes: It binds a URL to a view function, making it accessible to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handles HTTP Requests: It can be configured to handle different HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST).\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Routing: Instead of manually mapping URLs to functions, @app.route() provides a clean and readable way to define routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "###8.**What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods**?\n",
        ">The GET and POST HTTP methods are both used for sending requests to a server, but they serve different purposes and behave differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET Method:\n",
        "Purpose: Used to request data from a server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Handling: Sends data as URL parameters (query strings) in the URL (e.g., example.com/page?name=John&age=25).\n",
        "\n",
        "Visibility: Parameters are visible in the URL, making it less secure for sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Caching: GET requests are often cached by browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotency: Safe to repeat multiple times without changing the state of the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases: Fetching web pages, search queries, API calls that retrieve data.\n",
        "\n",
        "POST Method:\n",
        "Purpose: Used to send data to a server to create or update resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Handling: Sends data in the request body (hidden from URL).\n",
        "\n",
        "Visibility: Data is not visible in the URL, making it more secure for sensitive data like passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "Caching: Typically not cached by browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Idempotency: Not idempotent—repeating the request may create multiple records or perform different actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases: Submitting forms, creating new records in a database, uploading files.\n",
        "\n",
        "###9.**How do you handle errors in Flask APIs**?\n",
        ">Handling errors in Flask APIs is crucial for providing meaningful feedback to users and ensuring the application runs smoothly. Here are some best practices for error handling in Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "###10.**How do you connect Flask to a SQL database**?\n",
        ">To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use SQLAlchemy, which is a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Python. Below are the steps to set up the connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "###11.**What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy**?\n",
        ">Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python, with Flask applications. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with databases using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "###12.**What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful**?\n",
        ">Flask Blueprints are a way to organize and modularize a Flask application. They allow you to define reusable components (routes, templates, and static files) that can be registered to a main Flask app.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity – Helps break a large application into smaller, manageable components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Organization – Keeps related routes and logic together, making the codebase cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability – Allows code to be reused across different applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Team Collaboration – Developers can work on different Blueprints independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "###13.What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        ">Flask's request object is used to access incoming request data in a Flask application. It provides access to information about the client's request, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Form Data – Data sent via HTML forms (request.form).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Query Parameters – Data sent in the URL (request.args).\n",
        "\n",
        "  JSON Data – JSON payload in a request body (request.json).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Headers – Request headers (request.headers).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Files – Uploaded files (request.files).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Cookies – Client cookies (request.cookies).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Request Method – HTTP method used (request.method).\n",
        "\n",
        "  URL and Path Information – The URL and request path (request.url, request.path)\n",
        "\n",
        "###14.**How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask**?\n",
        ">Creating a RESTful API endpoint using Flask is straightforward. Follow these steps:\n",
        "1. Install Flask\n",
